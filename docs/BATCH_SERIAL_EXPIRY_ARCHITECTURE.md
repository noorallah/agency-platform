# Enterprise Batch, Lot, Serial & Expiry Management Architecture

## Phase 16B – Enterprise Traceability Framework

---

## Overview

Phase 16B introduces a complete enterprise-grade traceability layer above the Inventory Foundation (Phase 16A). It supports Batch, Lot, Serial Number, and Expiry tracking for multiple industries without redesigning any existing modules.

## Business Profile Integration

The framework is driven by Business Profile feature flags. No values are hardcoded.

| Profile | Batch | Lot | Serial | Expiry |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Medical/Pharmacy | ✓ Required | Optional | Optional | ✓ Required |
| Food | ✓ Required | Optional | ✗ | ✓ Required |
| Electronics | Optional | ✗ | ✓ Required | ✗ |
| Manufacturing | ✓ | ✓ Required | Optional | ✗ |
| General Trading | Configurable | Configurable | Configurable | Configurable |

The `BusinessProfileFeatureFlag` and `ProductConfig` tables (Phase 10) control which fields are required/optional per profile.

---

## Inventory Integration

- `InventoryTransaction` now has optional FK columns: `batch_id`, `lot_id`, `serial_id`
- These are populated at receipt/issue time when the product tracking flags demand it
- Stock ledger entries remain unchanged — traceability is at the transaction layer

---

## A serial's status moves with the stock (D-STK-4)

Until 2026-09-19 nothing outside `app/batch_serial` read or wrote
`serial_numbers`, and no movement set `inventory_transactions.serial_id`: a
mixer grinder that left on a delivery note kept its serial `AVAILABLE` for
ever. The owner decided on 2026-09-18 that **the storekeeper picks the
units**:

- **A delivery note line for a serial-tracked product** (`products.track_serial`)
  names the units going out in `serial_ids` -- the product's `AVAILABLE`
  serials in the line's warehouse. Saving refuses a unit named twice, of
  another product, in another warehouse, or not `AVAILABLE`; a draft may be
  picked short.
- **Dispatch refuses** until the line names exactly one serial per unit
  leaving (`delivered_quantity`, free goods included, in the stock unit),
  naming the line and the shortfall, and re-checks each unit -- two drafts may
  pick the same one, and only the first to ship takes it. Each unit then
  becomes `SOLD`, `current_owner` becomes the customer's name, and an audit
  row `serial_number.sold` is written, all inside the dispatch's own
  transaction.
- **A sales return line** names the units coming back, from those whose
  latest dispatch was the source line (`GET
  /api/v1/sales-returns/returnable-serials` lists them; a return against a
  bill reaches the note line through the bill line's source). Completing it
  refuses unless there is one serial per unit returned, then makes each
  `AVAILABLE` in the warehouse, branch and stock row the goods landed in
  (`serial_number.returned`). Cancelling a completed return makes them `SOLD`
  again (`serial_number.return_cancelled`) -- and is refused if one of them has
  been sold on since.
- **A delivery note cannot be cancelled once dispatched**, so there is no
  dispatch reversal to undo.

`document_line_serials` (migration `20260919_0138`) holds the picks: one row
per unit per line, with the document, the line, the movement that carried the
unit and when (`moved_at`, empty while it is only picked). A dispatch posts one
movement per **batch** drawn from, not one per unit, so the rows are where a
movement's units are listed; `inventory_transactions.serial_id` is set only
where a movement carried exactly one unit. `app/batch_serial/services/serial_trail_service.py`
owns all of it and never commits.

Decisions taken, following what Tally, SAP Business One, Odoo and Zoho do:

- **The document that issues the stock names the units.** A firm whose
  delivery note stage is off bills and ships in one step, so the bill line
  carries `serial_ids` and the sales chain hands them to the note it raises;
  a bill naming none for a serial-tracked product is refused by name before
  anything is staged. A bill of a note already dispatched names none -- its
  units were picked on the note -- and is refused if it tries.
- **A unit of a batch-tracked product leaves from its own batch.** Where the
  picked serials carry a `batch_id`, the dispatch draws from those batches
  instead of the earliest-expiry allocation, refusing a unit whose batch has
  expired or holds too little here; units with no batch leave the choice to
  the allocator, and a line mixing the two is refused.
- **The count is in the stock unit.** A line entered in another unit is
  counted by the server after conversion; the desktop checks the count only
  where the two units are the same.
- A return with damaged or scrap quantity still makes every returned unit
  `AVAILABLE`, as the owner specified; the stock row puts the damaged units in
  the damaged bucket, but the serial does not say which unit is which.
- `require_serial_on_issue` / `require_serial_on_receipt` are still read by
  nothing -- `track_serial` alone decides.
- Receiving stock (goods receipt, opening stock) numbers no units; serials are
  still created on the Serial Numbers screen or by the seeders.

## Traceability Strategy

### Forward Trace (from Batch)
```
Batch → InventoryTransaction (receipt) → Inventory
     → Future: SalesLine (issue)
     → Future: ManufacturingOrder
     → Future: ReturnLine
```

### Backward Trace (from Serial)
```
SerialNumber → batch_id → BatchRecord → vendor_id → Vendor
           → inventory_id → Inventory → warehouse → Branch
           → Future: SalesLine → Customer
```

### Extension Points
Each of `batches`, `lots`, `serial_numbers`, and `inventory_transactions` has FK slots ready for:
- Purchase Order Line (`purchase_line_id`) — future Phase 17
- Sales Order Line (`sales_line_id`) — future Phase 18
- Manufacturing Order (`manufacturing_order_id`) — future Phase 20
- Quality Control Hold (`qc_hold_id`) — future

---

## Future Integrations

### Purchase Module (Phase 17)
- GRN will populate `batch_id` / `lot_id` / `serial_id` on `InventoryTransaction`
- Batch receives `vendor_id` automatically from GRN

### Sales Module (Phase 18)
- Issue transactions record batch/serial consumed
- Serial status transitions: `available → sold` -- built for delivery notes
  and sales returns on 2026-09-19; see "A serial's status moves with the
  stock" above

### Manufacturing (Phase 20)
- Lot hierarchy (`parent_lot_id`) supports mixing/blending traceability
- Manufacturing orders create both input (consumed) and output (produced) lot transactions

### Warranty Management (future)
- `SerialNumber.warranty_end` is the extension point
- Warranty claim module reads serial status and flips to `returned` / `repaired`

### FEFO / FIFO (future)
- Batch `expiry_date` + `available_qty` are the data foundation
- Allocation engine will query batches ordered by `expiry_date ASC` (FEFO)

## Import / Export

Existing platform import/export framework applies:

| Operation | Format | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Batch Import | CSV / XLSX | POST `/api/v1/batch-serial/batches/import` (future) |
| Serial Import | CSV / XLSX | POST `/api/v1/batch-serial/serials/import` (future) |
| Batch Export | CSV / XLSX | GET `/api/v1/batch-serial/batches/export` (future) |
| Serial Export | CSV / XLSX | GET `/api/v1/batch-serial/serials/export` (future) |

Desktop Import Wizard (Phase 16A.1 pattern) can be reused directly for batch/serial bulk import.

---

## Migration

File: `backend/alembic/versions/20260801_0020_enterprise_batch_serial_expiry.py`

Operations (in order):
1. Create `batches` table
2. Create `lots` table
3. Create `serial_numbers` table
4. `ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN track_batch ...` (11 columns)
5. `ALTER TABLE inventory_transactions ADD COLUMN batch_id ...` (3 columns)

Down migration reverses all operations.

---

## Audit

All three new entities (`BatchRecord`, `LotRecord`, `SerialNumber`) extend `BaseEntity` which provides:
- `created_by`, `created_at`
- `updated_by`, `updated_at`
- `deleted_by`, `deleted_at` (soft delete)

Status transitions are recorded via the existing `record_audit` service.

---

## Test Coverage

### Backend (10 new unit tests)

- `test_batch_crud` — create/read/update/delete batch
- `test_batch_soft_delete` — soft delete leaves record with `deleted_at`
- `test_lot_crud` — create/read/update/delete lot
- `test_serial_crud` — create/read/update/delete serial
- `test_serial_soft_delete`
- `test_batch_summary` — aggregation by status
- `test_expiry_dashboard` — dashboard counters
- `test_batch_list_filtering` — status + warehouse filters
- `test_serial_status_transition` — available → sold
- `test_multi_firm_isolation` — batches are firm-scoped

### Desktop (4 new widget tests)

- `batch management page shows empty state for batches section`
- `batch management page renders batch grid when batches are returned`
- `serial management page shows empty state for serials section`
- `lot management page shows empty state for lots section`

---

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

1. **Import/Export endpoints** for batch and serial are not yet implemented — only the data model and framework hooks exist. Tracked for Phase 17+.
2. **Recall Workflow** is not implemented — `status = recalled` can be set manually via API but no automated notification/workflow exists.
3. **FEFO / FIFO allocation** is not implemented — batch data is ready but the allocation engine belongs to Purchase/Sales phases.
4. **QC Hold integration** — `blocked_qty` and `quarantine` status are data-model ready but no QC module enforces them yet.
5. **Lot hierarchy depth** — `parent_lot_id` supports one level of parent; deep multi-level lot trees may require recursive CTE queries (not yet implemented).
6. **Serial movement history** — current model records current status/owner but does not yet maintain a full movement log table. Extension point: `serial_movements` table in Phase 18.

---

## Breaking Changes

None. All existing APIs and tables are unchanged. New columns on `products` and `inventory_transactions` are nullable with `server_default=False` to avoid migration failures on populated databases.
