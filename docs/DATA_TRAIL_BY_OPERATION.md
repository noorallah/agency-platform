# Data trail by operation — what each action writes, and where to look

A companion to `docs/MANUAL_UI_TEST_PLAN.md` for checking at the **table**
level. The plan says what the screen should show; this says which rows an
action inserts, updates or soft-deletes, which audit row it writes and in
which store, and gives a query to paste. Every claim was read off the service
code on 2026-09-15 (the writes in `identity_service.py`, `firm_service.py`,
`readiness.py`), not from memory; the audit action names are the literal
strings the code records.

**Pass 1 covers the identity, roles, templates, firm-setup and audit
operations — plan sections 16 to 27.** The trading sections (sales, purchase,
stock, finance, loyalty, TCS) are `docs/WHAT_HAPPENS_CHECKLIST.md` at the
screen level and will be extended here section by section before each is
re-tested; a dispatch touches eight tables across four subsystems and is not
worth writing from memory.

---

## 1. How to look

### 1.1 Three places, not one

Firm-owned tables exist **once per store**. A query against the wrong schema
shows an empty table and looks like "nothing was written". This is the
single most common way a table-level check goes wrong here.

| What | Database | Schema | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform | `agency_platform` | `platform` | identity, roles, permissions, templates, firm registry, `user_preferences`, its own `audit_logs` |
| MEDI01, FOOD01 | `agency_platform` | `firm_shared` | both firms' trading data, side by side, told apart by `firm_id` |
| WHOLE01 | `agency_platform` | `wholesale_hub` | that firm alone |
| ELEC01 | **`agency_electrolink`** | `electrolink_ops` | that firm alone — **a separate connection in DbVisualizer** |

Set up two DbVisualizer connections: one to `agency_platform`, one to
`agency_electrolink`. Every query below is schema-qualified, so no
`search_path` is needed. Section 1 of `backend/scripts/sql/check_backend_data.sql`
prints this map from the registry if it ever changes.

### 1.2 Columns every business row carries

All entities extend `BaseEntity` (`app/core/database/entity.py`):

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | UUID |
| `created_at`, `created_by` / `updated_at`, `updated_by` | who and when; `*_by` is a user id |
| `version` | optimistic-concurrency counter, **+1 on every ORM update** — a row whose version moved was written, even if no visible column changed |
| `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` | **soft delete**. Nothing here is physically removed except by the reseed scripts. "Deleted" on screen means `is_deleted = true` |

`audit_logs` is the exception: append-only, no `version`, no soft-delete, and
a trigger refuses `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on it in every schema.

### 1.3 The audit trail is per store, and one screen merges two

- User, role, template and firm administration writes to **`platform.audit_logs`**, carrying `firm_id` where the action was about a firm.
- Everything a firm does to its own data writes to **that firm's** `audit_logs` (`wholesale_hub.audit_logs`, and so on).
- **Settings → Audit Logs** with a firm selected shows that firm's rows **merged with** the platform rows carrying its `firm_id`, in one time order. So a promotion you see in WHOLE01's screen is a `platform.audit_logs` row; querying `wholesale_hub.audit_logs` alone will not find it.

Columns: `created_at, action, entity_type, entity_id, actor_id, firm_id, before_data, after_data, ip_address, application_version`. `actor_id` and `entity_id` are UUIDs — the screen resolves them to names since #407/#409, the table does not.

### 1.4 The one query worth memorising

Before an operation, note the time. After it, this shows **everything the
operation wrote to that store's trail**:

```sql
select created_at, action, entity_type, entity_id, actor_id, firm_id,
       after_data
from   platform.audit_logs
where  created_at > now() - interval '2 minutes'
order  by created_at desc;
```

Swap `platform` for the firm's schema to see the firm-side rows. Two rows
for one click is normal: applying a template records both
`user_template.applied` and `user.roles_set`, because it goes through the
ordinary role-setting path.

### 1.5 Token revocation, which you cannot see in a table but will feel

Many identity writes end with `_revoke_user_tokens`, which does
`users.authorization_version += 1`. Every access token carries the version it
was minted with, and a request with a stale one is refused — so the person is
**signed out on their next click**, without being asked. Where a row below
says *revokes tokens*, that is the observable effect, and the column to check
is `users.authorization_version` before and after.

---

## 2. Signing in and out (plan sections 2, 16, 26a)

### Sign in — `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
- **Store:** platform
- **Inserts:** `login_history` — one row **per attempt, successful or not**: `attempted_email, outcome, client_ip, user_agent, failure_reason`. `refresh_tokens` — one row on success: `user_id, token_hash, expires_at, revoked_at (null)`.
- **Updates:** `users.last_login_at`; on a wrong password `users.failed_login_attempts += 1`, and at the threshold `users.locked_until` is set; on success both reset.
- **Audit:** `identity.login` (success only).
- **Check:**
  ```sql
  select created_at, attempted_email, outcome, failure_reason, client_ip
  from   platform.login_history
  order  by created_at desc limit 10;
  ```
  A lockout shows as several `outcome` failures then `locked_until` on the user; the refusal on screen names the state *before* the password is looked at, deliberately.

### Sign out — `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`
- **Updates:** `refresh_tokens.revoked_at` on the current token.
- **Audit:** `identity.logout`.

### Token refresh — automatic, once, after a 401
- **Inserts:** a new `refresh_tokens` row; the old one gets `revoked_at` and `replaced_by_id` pointing at the new one — a chain.
- **Audit:** `identity.refresh`. **Reusing a revoked token** records `identity.refresh_token_reuse_detected` and revokes **every** token the user holds (`authorization_version += 1`).

### Change own password — My profile → Change password
- **Inserts:** `password_history` (`user_id, password_hash`) — the old hash, so the last five cannot be reused.
- **Updates:** `users.password_hash`; `authorization_version += 1` (every session ends, including the one that changed it — the desktop returns to the login screen on purpose).
- **Audit:** `identity.password_changed`.

### Administrator resets somebody's password — user dialog footer, platform-only
- **Inserts:** `password_history` (the old hash, so the reset cannot be undone by changing back).
- **Updates:** `users.password_hash`, `force_password_change = true`, `locked_until = null`, `failed_login_attempts = 0`, `authorization_version += 1`.
- **Audit:** `user.password_reset`, `entity_id` = the user. Refused for the caller's own account.

---

## 3. Users (plan sections 20, 24, 26a)

### Create a user — Users → New (plan 20.2a, 22.0, 25.7)
- **Store:** platform
- **Inserts:** `users` (`email, full_name, password_hash, is_active, force_password_change`, the profile columns). For a **firm** caller, one `user_firms` row for the caller's own firm is written by `create_user` itself, then replaced by whatever the form's **Firms** box held (see *Set memberships* — this is why an empty Firms box used to remove the membership just created). Roles: see *Set roles* or *Apply job template*, which the form calls next.
- **Audit:** `user.created`, then `user.firms_set`, then either `user.roles_set` or (`user_template.applied` + `user.roles_set`). **Three or four rows for one Save.**
- **Check:**
  ```sql
  select u.email, u.is_active, u.force_password_change, u.authorization_version,
         uf.firm_id, uf.is_primary, uf.is_active as member_active, uf.is_deleted
  from   platform.users u
  left join platform.user_firms uf on uf.user_id = u.id
  where  u.email = 'plan22.test@agency.local';
  ```
- **Password policy:** minimum 12 characters, upper, lower, digit, symbol. The refusal on screen does not say which rule (BACKLOG 31.16); the server's `details` does.

### Update a user — Users → Edit (plan 20.1)
- **Updates:** `users` columns edited; `version += 1`; `authorization_version += 1` (revokes tokens — an edited person is signed out).
- **Audit:** `user.updated` with `before_data` / `after_data` holding the changed columns.
- **Refused** for a firm caller when the person also belongs to a firm the caller cannot see (`_assert_exclusive_firm_user`) — the desktop opens the view instead and says so in the subtitle.

### Delete a user — Users → Delete (plan 26/section on restore)
- **Updates:** `users.is_deleted = true, deleted_at, deleted_by`; `authorization_version += 1`.
- **Left in place, deliberately:** `user_firms`, `user_roles`, `user_preferences`, `refresh_tokens` rows — so a restore is one flag. The email is unique only among live accounts, so a new user may take it; restore is then refused by name.
- **Audit:** `user.deleted`.

### Restore a user — platform-only, from the Deleted filter
- **Updates:** `users.is_deleted = false, deleted_at = null`.
- **Audit:** `user.restored`.

### Set memberships — `PUT /users/{id}/firms`; Users → Edit → Firms; Add existing user; User-Firm Assignments (plan 20.5–20.7, 24.8, 24.19)
- **Soft-deletes:** `user_firms` rows for firms **not** in the request — for a **platform** caller that is every firm not named (replace); for a **firm** caller only firms within their reach, memberships elsewhere are carried through untouched (merge).
- **Inserts / updates:** a `user_firms` row per firm named (`is_primary, is_active`). A **scoped** caller never moves `is_primary`; only a person with no primary at all gets one.
- **Updates:** `users.authorization_version += 1`.
- **Audit:** `user.firms_set`.
- **Refused by name** when a firm caller names a firm they cannot staff — nothing written.
- **Check** (both rows survive after a scoped save, 20.6):
  ```sql
  select firm_id, is_primary, is_active, is_deleted, deleted_at, version
  from   platform.user_firms
  where  user_id = '<id>'
  order  by created_at;
  ```

### Set roles, global tier — Users → Edit → Roles (platform caller) or a firm caller's own firm (plan 20a)
- **Soft-deletes:** the user's existing `user_roles` rows in that tier (`firm_id is null` for the global tier; `firm_id = <firm>` for a firm caller — the server scopes it).
- **Inserts:** one `user_roles` row per role.
- **Updates:** `users.authorization_version += 1`.
- **Audit:** `user.roles_set`.

### Set roles in one firm — Roles by firm (plan 20a.4, 24.10)
- Same shape as above with `user_roles.firm_id = <firm>`.
- **Audit:** `user.firm_roles_set`.
- **Refused** for a firm the user is not a member of ("Add the user to this firm before giving them a role in it") and for a firm outside the caller's reach.

### Apply a job template — Users → Apply job template; Users → New with a job named (plan 23.4a, 25.7)
- **Writes exactly what *Set roles* writes**, through the same call — soft-delete the tier's `user_roles`, insert one per role in the template, `authorization_version += 1`.
- **Audit:** **two rows** — `user_template.applied` (`after_data`: `template_id`, `template_code`, `role_ids`, `role_codes`) and `user.roles_set`.
- **Nothing on the user records which template they came from** — deliberately. A user edited afterwards is no longer described by it.
- **Check:**
  ```sql
  select ur.firm_id, r.code, ur.is_deleted, ur.created_at
  from   platform.user_roles ur
  join   platform.roles r on r.id = ur.role_id
  where  ur.user_id = '<id>'
  order  by ur.created_at;
  ```

### Clone a user — Users → Hire like this person (plan section 18)
- **Inserts:** a new `users` row built from scratch (`force_password_change = true` always); `user_firms` copied from the source; `user_roles` copied within the caller's reach.
- **Not copied, deliberately:** mobile, employee code, joining date, photo, password, `password_history`, `login_history`, the source's audit rows, and never the `platform_admins` row.
- **Audit:** `user.cloned` with `source_user_id`, plus the `user.created` / `user.firms_set` / `user.roles_set` rows the build makes.

### Choose own primary firm — user menu → Primary firm (plan 26a.3)
- **Updates:** `user_firms.is_primary` — the old primary cleared **and flushed** before the new one is set, because `UQ_user_firms_active_primary` is checked per statement.
- **Audit:** `user.primary_firm_set`.

### Preferences — appearance, last screen, last firm (plan 26a, and the sign-in noise)
- **Store:** platform, `user_preferences` (one row per user, created on first read): `preferred_theme, preferred_theme_mode, preferred_high_contrast, preferred_palette, default_firm_id, default_landing_page, rows_per_page, …`
- **Audit:** `user_preferences.updated` — written **on every save, with no `before_data` or `after_data`**, including saves that change nothing. The desktop saves at sign-in and on every firm switch, so the platform trail gains a contentless row per sign-in. **Open question for the owner**: narrow it to real changes, stop auditing preferences, or leave it. `user_preferences.reset` when reset.

---

## 4. Roles and permissions (plan sections 20a, 25)

### Create a role — Roles & Permissions → Roles → New (plan 25.2)
- **Store:** platform, `roles` (`code, name, description, is_active, is_system = false, firm_id` = the caller's firm for a firm caller, `null` for a platform caller).
- **Audit:** `role.created`.
- **Refused:** a code spelling `platform_admin` or any of the sixteen seeded codes, case-insensitively — "'<code>' is reserved. Choose a different role code." `RoleCreate.code` is `^[a-z0-9._-]+$`, which *permits* that spelling, so the refusal is the service's.
- **Check:** `select code, name, firm_id, is_system, is_deleted from platform.roles where code = 'night-desk';`

### Set a role's permissions — the Permissions section of the same form (plan 25.3)
- **Soft-deletes / inserts:** `role_permissions` (`role_id, permission_id`) replaced.
- **Updates:** **every holder's** `users.authorization_version += 1` (`_revoke_role_users`) — they are all signed out on their next click. This is 25.9.
- **Audit:** `role.permissions_set`.
- **Refused:** any code in `PLATFORM_PERMISSION_CODES` named by a firm caller — and `list_permissions` never offers those 22 to a firm caller in the first place, so the picker shows 167 of 189.
- **Check:**
  ```sql
  select p.code, rp.is_deleted
  from   platform.role_permissions rp
  join   platform.permissions p on p.id = rp.permission_id
  join   platform.roles r on r.id = rp.role_id
  where  r.code = 'night-desk' order by p.code;
  ```

### Edit a role's name / description (plan 25.9 is permissions, not this)
- **Audit:** `role.updated`; also revokes every holder's tokens.

### Delete a role — while people hold it (plan 25.10)
- **Updates:** `roles.is_deleted = true`; every holder's `authorization_version += 1`.
- **Left in place:** the `user_roles` rows pointing at it — the person's row still names a deleted role, and the token simply no longer carries its codes. **No refusal, no count of holders** — the only guard is `is_system`.
- **Audit:** `role.deleted`.
- **Check** who was holding it before you delete (the plan's advice):
  ```sql
  select u.email, ur.firm_id
  from   platform.user_roles ur join platform.users u on u.id = ur.user_id
  join   platform.roles r on r.id = ur.role_id
  where  r.code = 'night-desk' and ur.is_deleted = false;
  ```

### Permissions themselves
Seeded by migration; `permission.created/updated/deleted` exist for the platform administrator only. A firm never writes this table.

---

## 5. User templates (plan sections 17, 19, 25.6)

- **Store:** platform — `/api/v1/user-templates` is a platform path. Tables `user_templates` (`code, name, description, firm_id, is_active, is_system`) and `user_template_roles` (`template_id, role_id`).
- **`firm_id is null` means offered to every firm**; the eleven seeded ones are `is_system = true`. A firm caller's create gets their own `firm_id`; a platform caller's **Offered to** chip sets it, blank leaves it null. `code` is unique **per scope** (two partial indexes, because NULLs are distinct).
- **Create:** inserts both tables; audit `user_template.created`. Roles are validated against the *owning* firm at creation, not only at apply.
- **Update:** `user_template.updated`; **Delete:** `user_templates.is_deleted = true`, `user_template.deleted`. A firm caller changing a template with `firm_id is null` is refused (422, "offered to every firm, so only a platform administrator…").
- **Check:**
  ```sql
  select t.code, t.firm_id, t.is_system, t.is_active, t.is_deleted, r.code as role
  from   platform.user_templates t
  left join platform.user_template_roles tr on tr.template_id = t.id and tr.is_deleted = false
  left join platform.roles r on r.id = tr.role_id
  where  t.code in ('food-night','every-night','night-desk-job');
  ```
- **Observation, checked against the database on 2026-09-15, not yet acted on:** `user_templates` / `user_template_roles` are absent from `_PLATFORM_TABLES` in `app/core/tenancy/lifecycle.py`, so **provisioning does not prune them** from a store it builds — `SNTEST01`, provisioned through the app in section 27, carries an empty `user_templates`; `wholesale_hub`, built by the seeder, does not. Nothing reads the copy. If you see the table in a firm schema, it is empty and not the real one; `platform.user_templates` is.

---

## 6. Firms and setting one up (plan sections 19, 27)

All routes under `/api/v1/firms` are platform-only. The registry rows are in `platform`; the setup actions write into **the new firm's own store**, and their audit rows go to **the platform trail**.

### Create a firm — Administration → Firms → New (plan 27.3–27.9)
- **Inserts:** `firms` (`code` upper-cased, `name, country, currency_code, financial_year_start, status, is_active, gst_number, pan_number`) and `firm_storage_mappings` (`deployment_mode, database_name, schema_name, connection_profile, provisioned_at = null`).
- **Audit:** `firm.created`.
- **Refused:** duplicate `code`/`gst_number`/`pan_number` among **live** firms (409); an unknown `connection_profile` (422, at creation, not at first use); two firms on one database/schema pair.
- **Nothing is built yet** for `SCHEMA`/`DATABASE` modes — the schema does not exist until provisioning.

### Update / delete a firm
- `firm.updated` — any change to `deployment_mode`/`schema_name`/`database_name`/`connection_profile` is refused: routing is fixed at creation. `firm.deleted` soft-deletes; the data stays where it is.

### Provision storage — Set up → Provision storage (plan 27.11–27.13)
- **Creates** the database (DATABASE mode) and schema, runs `alembic upgrade head` in a **subprocess** against it, prunes the platform tables from it.
- **Updates:** `firm_storage_mappings.provisioned_at` (or `provisioning_error` with the reason, on failure).
- **Audit:** `firm.storage_provisioned` (platform). Re-running is safe and is the repair action.
- **Check:** `select code, provisioned_at, provisioning_error from platform.firm_storage_mappings m join platform.firms f on f.id = m.firm_id;`
  and, in DbVisualizer, that the new schema now lists ~180 tables.

### Open the books — Set up → Open the books (plan 27.23c–d)
- **Store:** the **firm's** store. **Inserts:** `ledger_accounts` (24, the default chart), `financial_years` (1 — the year *today* falls in, aligned to the firm's year start), `accounting_periods` (12), `journal_types`, `voucher_types`, `firm_control_accounts` (24, one per posting purpose).
- **Audit:** `firm.books_opened` on the **platform** trail, **only when something was created** — a second press answers `already_open: true` and writes no row.
- **Check** (WHOLE01's schema shown; use the new firm's). On a freshly opened firm expect `24, 1, 12, 24`. On WHOLE01 itself, checked 2026-09-15, it reads **25, 3, 36, 24** — one account was added by hand in section 13 and the demo history spans three financial years, so those are not the template's numbers and not a fault:
  ```sql
  select (select count(*) from wholesale_hub.ledger_accounts        where is_deleted = false) as accounts,
         (select count(*) from wholesale_hub.financial_years        where is_deleted = false) as years,
         (select count(*) from wholesale_hub.accounting_periods     where is_deleted = false) as periods,
         (select count(*) from wholesale_hub.firm_control_accounts  where is_deleted = false) as mapped;
  ```

### Apply the GST template — Set up → Apply GST template (plan 27.23f)
- **Store:** the firm's. **Inserts:** `tax_systems` (1), `tax_components` (4: CGST, SGST, IGST, CESS), `tax_profiles` (8), `tax_rules` (6, with their conditions and actions), and `geo_countries` (India) **if the store has no country** — a dedicated store has no geography at all.
- **Audit:** `firm.tax_template_applied` (platform), only when something was created; idempotent on "already has a tax system".

### Create the default branch and warehouse — Set up → Create head office and main warehouse (plan 27.23i)
- **Store:** the firm's. **Inserts:** `branches` (`code = 'HO'`, `is_default = true`) and `warehouses` (`code = 'MAIN'`, `branch_id` = HO). Idempotent per half: a firm that already named a branch gets only the warehouse, under its default branch.
- **Audit:** `firm.default_branch_created` (platform), only when something was created.

### Assign a business profile — Set up → Business profile, or Profile Assignment (plan 27.18–27.20, 27.23g)
- **Store:** the **named firm's** store (the platform endpoint opens it with `firm_store_session`). **Inserts / updates:** `firm_business_profiles` (`firm_id, business_profile_id, is_active, effective_from`).
- **Audit:** no `*.assigned` action appears in the code's action list for this write — verify on screen rather than in `audit_logs`. If you find a row, tell me and I will correct this line.
- **Check:** `select business_profile_id, is_active, effective_from from wholesale_hub.firm_business_profiles where is_deleted = false;`
- **Trap this closed:** until 2026-08 the write went into the **caller's** store while reporting success; MEDI01 and FOOD01 hid it by sharing `firm_shared`.

### Readiness — Set up panel, `GET /firms/{id}/readiness`
- **Writes nothing.** Reads the counts above from the firm's store and answers seven steps; `scripts/check_firm_readiness.py` prints the same seven from the same implementation.

---

## 7. Reading the audit trail (plan section 23)

- **`GET /api/v1/audit-logs` with no `X-Firm-ID`** → `platform.audit_logs`, platform authority required.
- **With `X-Firm-ID`** → that firm's `audit_logs` **merged with** `platform.audit_logs where firm_id = <firm>`, exact merge: `page * page_size` from each store, sliced in one time order. Both stores get the same filters. A store is never merged with itself.
- **Filters are exact match** on `action` and `entity_type` (BACKLOG 31.17).
- **Query the merge by hand** (WHOLE01):
  ```sql
  select created_at, action, entity_type, entity_id, actor_id, 'firm' as store
  from   wholesale_hub.audit_logs where firm_id = '30c66274-60e9-4789-97d9-138a7a1fdc61'
  union all
  select created_at, action, entity_type, entity_id, actor_id, 'platform'
  from   platform.audit_logs      where firm_id = '30c66274-60e9-4789-97d9-138a7a1fdc61'
  order  by created_at desc limit 40;
  ```
  The `store` column is what 23.4b is checking: the two should interleave by time, not sit in two blocks.

---

## 8. Things that are *not* written, and are often looked for

| You might expect | What actually happens |
| --- | --- |
| A row saying which template a user came from | Nothing on `users`; only the `user_template.applied` audit row records it |
| Physical deletion anywhere | Never in the application; `is_deleted = true` |
| A firm's user rows in the firm's store | `users`, `user_firms`, `user_roles` are **platform-only**; the firm store has none |
| An audit row for a read | Reads write nothing, including readiness and the audit screen itself |
| A refused write leaving a partial row | A refusal is raised before commit; nothing lands — with one known exception, 20.2b before #402, where the user was created and the roles call then failed |
| A `user_preferences.updated` row meaning something changed | It fires on every save, with nothing on either side — see §3 |
